# Vending Machine

App for calculating the change required for a given monetary value with the minimum number of coins possible.  
There are two public methods for calculating this, one which takes a coin inventory and attempts to take change from this, and one which assumes an infinite supply of coins. Both can be found in the VendingMachine class.
